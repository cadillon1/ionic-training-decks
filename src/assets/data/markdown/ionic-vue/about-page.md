# Lab: The About Page

Every good app gives credit where credit is due. We will use a traditional "About" page for that in this app. This should be a short and mostly "for fun" lab, so let's get right to it.

## Get the Data

Modify the application's `tsconfig.json` file to the code to resolve JSON files:

```json
  "compilerOptions": {
...
    "resolveJsonModule": true,
...
```

This will allow us to read the `package.json` file and get some important informtion from it which we can then return via our `setup()` function. Note that there is no reason for this data to be reactive.

```html
<template>
  <ion-page>
    <ion-header>
      <ion-toolbar>
        <ion-title>About Tea Taster</ion-title>
      </ion-toolbar>
    </ion-header>

    <ion-content class="ion-text-center ion-padding">
      <ion-list>
        <ion-list-header>About</ion-list-header>
        <ion-item>
          <ion-label>Name</ion-label>
          <ion-note slot="end">{{ name }}</ion-note>
        </ion-item>
        <ion-item>
          <ion-label>Description</ion-label>
          <ion-note slot="end">{{ description }}</ion-note>
        </ion-item>
        <ion-item>
          <ion-label>Version</ion-label>
          <ion-note slot="end">{{ version }}</ion-note>
        </ion-item>
        <ion-item>
          <ion-label>Author</ion-label>
          <ion-note slot="end">{{ author }}</ion-note>
        </ion-item>
      </ion-list>
    </ion-content>
  </ion-page>
</template>

<script lang="ts">
  import // Be sure to add the missing components here
  '@ionic/vue';
  import { defineComponent } from 'vue';

  import { author, description, name, version } from '../../package.json';

  export default defineComponent({
    name: 'About',
    components: {
      // Be sure to add the missing components here
    },
    setup() {
      return { author, description, name, version };
    },
  });
</script>
```

**Note:** You may need to add the `author` node to the `package.json` file. You can just your your name like this: `"author": "Jackie Smith",`.

**Note:** If you change the `ion-title` value like I did here you will also need to reflect that change in your test.

## Move the Logout Logic

Currently, the logout logic is on the first page. Once the user has logged in, it is doubtful they will need to logout, so it would make more sense to put that functionallity on a page like the "My Account" page, or "My Profile". We don't have one of those, but the about page will do for now.

We start by moving the 'dispatches a logout action when the logout button is clicked' test from the `TeaList` view's test to the `About` view's test.

Here are the test you will need to move from the `TestList` test file to the `About` test file. You will also need to do the `router` creation and configuration in the `About` test, and modify the dispatch mock to return a resovled value. Use the `TeaList` test as a model.

```typescript
it('dispatches a logout action when the logout button is clicked', () => {
  const button = wrapper.findComponent('[data-testid="logout-button"]');
  button.trigger('click');
  expect(store.dispatch).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1);
  expect(store.dispatch).toHaveBeenCalledWith('logout');
});

it('navigates to the login after the dispatch is complete', async () => {
  const button = wrapper.findComponent('[data-testid="logout-button"]');
  await button.trigger('click');
  expect(router.replace).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1);
  expect(router.replace).toHaveBeenCalledWith('/login');
});
```

I leave it up to you to move the proper code from `src/views/TeaList.vue` to `src/views/About.vue` and then clean up the `TeaList` code.

Be sure that:

- All of your tests are passing.
- You have no lint errors.
- Your app builds cleanly.
- Your app runs in the browser without warnings or errors in the console.
- Your app runs well on your devices.

If any of these are not the case, we should spend some time doing a little debugging.

## Conclusion

Congratulations, you have written a complete Ionic Framework app. Feel free to bump the version to 1.0.0 in your `package.json` file! ðŸ¥³ðŸŽ‰ðŸ¤“
